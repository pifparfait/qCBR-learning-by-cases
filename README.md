# qCBR-learning-by-cases
A supervised classifier can be interpreted as a program capable of predicting the output of input from the labelled data. From the input data and the label, with known examples, we will be able to, which will be the label given new input.  The main idea of quantum Case-Based Reasoning (qCBR) is to interpret the statement of the problem as an input and the solution to the problem as an output. Therefore, if we have a series of situations with their outcomes, we can train our classifier to determine its solution given a new problem.
